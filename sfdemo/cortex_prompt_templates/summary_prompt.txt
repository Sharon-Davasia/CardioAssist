===== INSTRUCTIONS =====

Analyze the patient data and provide a clinical summary using this EXACT format:

1. Start with a priority marker in bold:
   - **CRITICAL:** for immediately life-threatening conditions
   - **URGENT:** for serious conditions requiring prompt intervention
   - **MODERATE:** for conditions needing medical attention but not immediately critical
   - **LOW PRIORITY:** for minor conditions that can be addressed with standard wait times

2. Provide 2-4 key clinical observations in a single paragraph, highlighting:
   - Most concerning vital signs or symptoms
   - Risk factors from medical history
   - Potential differential diagnoses

3. End with "**Recommend:**" followed by immediate next steps (diagnostics, consultations, interventions)

===== GUIDELINES =====

- Keep total response under 100 words
- Use medical terminology appropriately (target audience: physicians, nurses)
- Focus on actionable information
- Mention specific vital sign values that are abnormal
- Consider age and comorbidities in assessment
- Do NOT include disclaimers or caveats
- Do NOT use lists or bullet points (except for recommendations)
- Be direct and decisive

===== EXAMPLE OUTPUT =====

**CRITICAL:** 68M presenting with classic acute coronary syndrome symptoms. Chest pain + SOB + cardiac history = high MI probability. Tachycardia (112), elevated BP (160/95), reduced O2 sat (92%). Previous MI in 2019 significantly increases risk. **Recommend:** Immediate 12-lead ECG, troponin levels, cardiology consult STAT, consider cath lab activation.
